## Synopsis

This game uses the card and deck classes from the Elevens Lab. It is a simple blackjack game that keeps track of the score using a txt file.

## Interface

The DeckInterface interface is used to implement the Deck.

## Abstract

The hand is an abstract class which the BlackjackHand extends.

## Text File I/O

The GUIRunner checks for log.txt in the package directory, and if it does not exist, creates one. For each win, tie, or loss, a "W", "T", or "L" and a newline is appended.
